Data Analytics Bootcamp - Project 3 - Group 2
Project Name
Description
This project aims to create a dynamic and interactive web application using Python Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and a chosen database. The application will showcase data visualizations based on a well-documented dataset containing a minimum of 100 unique records. The visualizations will present insights and trends in a clear and digestible manner, allowing users of all levels to interpret the data story effectively. The project will also incorporate user-driven interactions, such as dropdowns, filters, or zoom features, to enhance the user experience.
